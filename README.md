# Arduino Monitor

A playground for a simple arduno monitor that cycles through a few loops indefinitely to provide some info about either my system or a remote HPC system (coming in the future)

Designed to run with the modified SerialDisplay arduino example (supplied) on the arduino uno R3 with an LCD Keypad Shield (duinotech XC-4454) using the HD44780 protocol.

Was initially inspired by a joke that *"We really need seven segment display counters to count down how many allocated compute hours we have left each quarter"*
